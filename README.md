## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database service used for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
- **ElastiCache(Redis)**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a cache and message broker.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: A service for defining and deploying infrastructure as code, ensuring consistent and repeatable architectural deployments.
- **AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: A message queuing service used to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD platform used for building, testing, and deploying code directly from GitHub repositories.
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, automatically scaling with usage.
- **AWS CloudFront**: A fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- **AWS API Gateway**: A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

## Installation

**Clone the repository and build the project**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pchchv/go-url-shortener.git
cd go-url-shortener
make build
```

## Usage

### Deploying to AWS Lambda

- Deploy functions to AWS Lambda using:
  ```sh
  make deploy
  ```
  This command will use AWS SAM to deploy serverless functions.

### Running Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests for specific functions:

  ```sh
  make unit-test
  ```

- **Benchmark Tests**: Perform benchmark tests:
  ```sh
  make benchmark-test
  ```

### Cleaning Up

- To clean up the build artifacts:

  ```sh
  make clean
  ```

- To delete the deployed stack:
  ```sh
  make delete
  ```
